### Explanation of bgArray 诸葛亮与八卦阵 (unnecessary)

1. First! The tips here are for those who want to use the multi tone resource package, [Shenyu resource package (Shenyu's own link)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/11uoq5zwN7c3rX-98DqVpJg) \(Extraction code: `ek3t`\)
2. Download it to any location on your PC. Note that it does ***not*** need to be placed in the directory where *Musicreater* are. The audio resource package is large, so you can choose to download only:`神羽资源包_乐器、音源的资源包\羽音缭绕-midiout_25.0`.
    Also, you can download only `神羽资源包_乐器\音源的资源包\羽音缭绕-midiout_25.0\mcpack(国际版推荐)格式_25.0` or 
    `神羽资源包_乐器\音源的资源包\羽音缭绕-midiout_25.0\zip格式_25.0`.
4. The next step is the most IMPORTANT: to bind the resource package to *Musicreater*
    First, open *Musicreater*->Q&A->Select \[MiraclePlumeResourcePack\]... .At this time, in the selection box,
    the IMPORTANT step comes, select: ***The directory you downloaded: `羽音缭绕-midiout_25.0`, or also the parent directory `mcpack(国际版推荐)格式_25.0`or`zip格式_25.0`***
    For example, my file path is as follows:
    `L:\shenyu\音源的资源包\羽音缭绕-midiout_25.0` and in the directory, there are two folders and one .xls file:
    `神羽资源包_25.0_使用方法.xls`, `mcpack(国际版推荐)格式_25.0` and `zip格式_25.0`, so in *Musicreater* you should also select this folder: **L:\shenyu\音源的资源包\羽音缭绕-midiout_25.0**
6. If you want to use the Miracle Plume Bedrock Edition Audio Resource Pack to make .mcfunction s, you should use Musicreater -> Edit - > Import audio tracks from MIDI and parse them with a new method, and then use it
Musicreater - > function (package) - > the following four new functions
